# Implemented Plan for WorldConquest

## Project Setup (2025-04-21)

### ASP.NET Core Project
- Created a new ASP.NET Core Web API project using .NET 8
- Set up minimal API endpoints instead of controllers
- Added SignalR support for real-time communication
- Created a basic GameHub for SignalR communication
- Set up static file serving for the client-side application
- Configured the application to serve index.html at the root path
- Added custom 404 page handling for unrecognized endpoints

### TypeScript Client Project
- Created a TypeScript project in the 'client' folder
- Set up webpack for bundling TypeScript code
- Configured TypeScript to output to the ASP.NET wwwroot/js folder
- Created a basic client-side application with SignalR connection
- Set up a basic HTML structure with game canvas and UI elements

### Build and Run Scripts
- Created a run-dev.sh script for Linux/Mac users
- Created a run-dev.bat script for Windows users
- These scripts build the TypeScript code and then run the .NET application

### SignalR Messaging System Implementation (2025-04-21)

#### Client-Side (TypeScript)
- Implemented `SendMessage(messageName, data)` function to send messages from client to server
- Added message handling system with a switch statement to process different message types
- Created handler functions for various game actions (attack, build, move, upgrade, etc.)
- Made the SignalR connection globally accessible for use throughout the application
- Added automatic reconnection capability to the SignalR connection

#### Server-Side (C#)
- Implemented three message sending methods:
  - `SendMessageAll(messageName, data)` - Send to all connected clients
  - `SendMessageToGame(messageName, data, gameId)` - Send to all clients in a specific game
  - `SendMessageToClient(messageName, data, clientId)` - Send to a specific client
- Added `ReceiveClientMessage(messageName, data)` to receive messages from clients
- Implemented message handling system with a switch statement to process different message types
- Created handler methods for various game actions (attack, build, move, upgrade, end_turn)
- Added logging for better debugging and monitoring

### Next Steps
- Implement the game map rendering
- Add province data models and logic
- Implement country management
- Add game state management
- Implement turn-based gameplay
- Add lobby system
