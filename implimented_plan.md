# Implemented Plan

## Task 1: Project Setup
- Created ASP.NET Core 8.0 project with minimal API approach
- Set up static file hosting in Program.cs
- Added SignalR support for real-time communication
- Created basic frontend structure in wwwroot folder with HTML and CSS
- Set up TypeScript with webpack for bundling
- Created basic directory structure for TypeScript files (src/game, src/models, src/services)
- Added placeholder TypeScript files with basic structure
- Configured build scripts in package.json
- Created a comprehensive .gitignore file for ASP.NET and TypeScript projects

The project now has the following structure:
- ASP.NET Core backend with static file hosting and SignalR hub
- Frontend with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript
- Build system with webpack for TypeScript compilation
- Version control configuration with appropriate .gitignore settings

## Task 2: Model Classes and SignalR Configuration
- Created comprehensive C# model classes for the backend:
  - Province (with RGB color ID from bitmap)
  - Building
  - Country
  - Army
  - Unit
  - Player
  - Lobby
  - GameState
- Created corresponding TypeScript model classes for the frontend
- Implemented service interfaces and classes for the backend:
  - ILobbyService and LobbyService for managing game lobbies
  - IGameService and GameService for managing game state
- Updated the GameHub class to implement SignalR communication
- Implemented the SignalRService in TypeScript for frontend communication
- Updated the GameManager class to use the models and services
- Added CORS configuration to allow cross-origin requests
- Created test API endpoints to verify connectivity
- Created a test page (test.html) to verify SignalR connectivity

The project now has:
- A complete set of model classes for both backend and frontend
- Working SignalR communication between frontend and backend
- Service layer for managing game state and lobbies
- Test page for verifying connectivity

## Task 3: Backend API Calls and Lobby Management
- Added missing SignalR endpoints for game state management:
  - SaveGameState for saving the current game state
  - LoadGameState for loading a saved game state
- Enhanced the SignalRService in TypeScript to support these new endpoints
- Updated the GameManager class to implement lobby UI functionality
- Created a dedicated lobby.html page with a user interface for:
  - Creating new lobbies
  - Joining existing lobbies
  - Setting player ready status
  - Starting games
  - Loading saved games
- Added a saved games API endpoint to retrieve available saved games
- Updated webpack configuration to support multiple entry points (main game and lobby)
- Added navigation between the game and lobby pages
- Implemented turn management with the ability to end turns and advance to the next turn
- Added styling for the lobby interface

The project now has:
- A complete lobby system for creating and joining games
- The ability to save and load game states
- Turn management functionality
- A user-friendly interface for managing lobbies and games

## Task 4: Frontend Map Display and Game UI Implementation
- Created a MapRenderer class to handle map rendering and interaction
- Implemented canvas-based map display with the following features:
  - Zoom and pan functionality using mouse wheel and drag
  - Keyboard controls (WASD, arrow keys) for map navigation
  - Edge-of-screen panning when the mouse is near the edge
  - Map control buttons for zooming in/out and resetting the view
- Added province selection functionality:
  - Clicking on a province selects it and displays its information
  - Province information panel shows details like owner, type, level, etc.
  - For owned provinces, action buttons are displayed for upgrades and building construction
- Enhanced the game UI structure:
  - Header with game information (date, turn, money)
  - Left and right side menus for game information and controls
  - Map canvas in the center with interactive controls
  - Game chat at the bottom
- Implemented fully functional game chat:
  - Send messages by clicking the send button or pressing Enter
  - Display of player names and timestamps with messages
  - Special styling for ally-only messages
  - Automatic cleanup of old messages to prevent memory issues
- Added CSS styling for all UI elements:
  - Province panels with proper formatting
  - Chat message styling
  - Map control buttons
  - Responsive layout adjustments

The project now has:
- A complete game UI with interactive map display
- Zoom and pan functionality for the map
- Province selection and information display
- Fully functional game chat
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

Next steps will be Task 5: Backend functions for all major player actions.

## Lobby Integration
- Integrated the lobby system directly into the main game page as a dialog overlay
- Modified the index.html file to include the lobby UI as a dialog
- Updated the CSS to style the lobby dialog properly
- Modified the index.ts file to handle both game and lobby functionality
- Updated the GameManager.ts to support showing/hiding the lobby dialog
- Updated webpack.config.js to remove the separate lobby entry point
- The lobby now appears as an overlay on top of the game, and disappears when a game starts
- Added a "Show Lobby" button to allow players to return to the lobby from the game

This integration improves the user experience by:
1. Eliminating the need to navigate between separate pages
2. Providing a seamless transition between lobby and gameplay
3. Allowing players to access lobby functions without leaving the game context

## Chat System Bug Fix
- Fixed an issue where chat messages would disappear from the input box but not appear in the chat box
- Enhanced the `addChatMessage` method in GameManager.ts to ensure the chat messages container is visible
- Improved the `sendChatMessage` method to handle cases where no active game state exists:
  - Added user-friendly error messages that appear in the chat when trying to send messages without an active game
  - Implemented better error handling to display error messages in the chat interface
- Fixed a critical issue with event handlers for the GameStarted event:
  - Modified SignalRService.ts to support multiple callbacks for the GameStarted event
  - Changed onGameStarted from a single callback to an array of callbacks (onGameStartedCallbacks)
  - Updated the setOnGameStarted method to add callbacks to the array instead of replacing them
  - Properly separated responsibilities between GameManager.ts and index.ts
  - GameManager.ts now focuses on setting the game state and updating the UI
  - index.ts handles hiding the lobby dialog when a game starts
  - This ensures the game state is properly set when a game starts, allowing chat messages to be sent
  - Fixed an issue where the lobby dialog wasn't being hidden when starting a game:
    - Added direct code to hide the lobby dialog in the startGame method
    - Implemented immediate hiding of the dialog when the start button is clicked
    - Added error handling to show the dialog again if game start fails
    - Completely overhauled the lobby hiding mechanism:
      - Enhanced the hideLobbyDialog function with multiple approaches to force the lobby to hide
      - Added temporary DOM removal and reinsertion to ensure the lobby is hidden
      - Set display:none with !important to override any conflicting styles
    - Enhanced the GameStarted event handler in index.ts to hide the lobby dialog on ALL clients:
      - Added multiple calls to hideLobbyDialog with different delays
      - Implemented a custom gameStarted event to ensure all parts of the application know when a game starts
      - Added direct gameState setting in the event handler to ensure the game state is available
    - Added a visible "Game Started!" notification that appears briefly when the game starts
  - Added detailed logging to help diagnose issues with game state initialization
  - Added temporary game state and system messages to improve user experience during game startup
- Added additional logging to help diagnose chat-related issues
- Improved the message display logic to ensure messages are properly added to the UI

## Lobby Dialog Hiding Fix
- Fixed an issue where the lobby overlay would disappear on the host's screen but not on other players' screens when a game starts
- Simplified the lobby hiding mechanism to ensure it works consistently across all clients:
  - Directly set display:none on the lobby dialog element when the GameStarted event is received
  - Added clear logging to help diagnose any future issues with lobby hiding
  - Ensured the same simple approach is used in both the GameManager and index.ts
